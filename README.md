3. numpy
4. scipy

This architecture can be used for unsupervised representation learning in varied domains, including textual and structured data. The following paper uses this stacked denoising autoencoder for learning patient representations from clinical notes, and thereby evaluating them for different clinical end tasks in a supervised setup:
